## Setup

### First App
Let's write a simple rule:  

1. Start a terminal  
2. Create a directory for your app: `mkdir firstapp` `cd firstapp`  
3. In the new directory `gem install durable_rules` (this will download durable_rules and its dependencies)  
4. In that same directory create a test.rb file using your favorite editor  
5. Copy/Paste and save the following code:  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :test do
  when_all (m.subject == "World") do
    puts "Hello #{m.subject}"
  end
end

Durable.post :test, { :subject => "World"}
```  

7. In the terminal type `ruby test.rb`  
8. You should see the message: `Hello World`  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents) 

## Basics
### Rules
A rule is the basic building block of the framework. The rule antecendent defines the conditions that need to be satisfied to execute the rule consequent (action). By convention `m` represents the data to be evaluated by a given rule.

* `when_all` and `when_any` annotate the antecendent definition of a rule
  
```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :test do
  # antecedent
  when_all m.subject == "World" do
    # consequent
    puts "Hello #{m.subject}"
  end
end

Durable.post :test, { :subject => "World" }
```  
### Facts
Facts represent the data that defines a knowledge base. After facts are asserted as JSON objects. Facts are stored until they are retracted. When a fact satisfies a rule antecedent, the rule consequent is executed.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :animal do
  # will be triggered by 'Kermit eats flies'
  when_all c.first = (m.predicate == "eats") & (m.object == "flies") do
    assert :subject => first.subject, :predicate => "is", :object => "frog"
  end

  when_all (m.predicate == "eats") & (m.object == "worms") do
    assert :subject => m.subject, :predicate => "is", :object => "bird"
  end
  
  # will be chained after asserting 'Kermit is frog'
  when_all (m.predicate == "is") & (m.object == "frog") do
    assert :subject => m.subject, :predicate => "is", :object => "green"
  end
    
  when_all (m.predicate == "is") & (m.object == "bird") do
    assert :subject => m.subject, :predicate => "is", :object => "black"
  end
    
  when_all +m.subject do
    puts "fact: #{m.subject} #{m.predicate} #{m.object}"
  end
end

Durable.assert :animal, { :subject => "Kermit", :predicate => "eats", :object => "flies" }
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Events
Events can be posted to and evaluated by rules. An event is an ephemeral fact, that is, a fact retracted right before executing a consequent. Thus, events can only be observed once. Events are stored until they are observed. 

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :risk do
  when_all c.first = m.t == "purchase",
           c.second = m.location != first.location do
    # the event pair will only be observed once
    puts "fraud detected -> #{first.location}, #{second.location}"
  end
end

Durable.post :risk, { :t => "purchase", :location => "US" }
Durable.post :risk, { :t => "purchase", :location => "CA" }
```  

**Note:**  

*Using facts in the example above will produce the following output:*   

<sub>`Fraud detected -> US, CA`</sub>  
<sub>`Fraud detected -> CA, US`</sub>  

*The reason is because both facts satisfy the first condition m.t == 'purchase' and each fact satisfies the second condition m.location != c.first.location in relation to the facts which satisfied the first.*  

*Events are ephemeral facts, they are retracted before they are dispatched. When using post in the example above, by the time the second pair is calculated the events have already been retracted.*  

*Retracting events before dispatch reduces the number of combinations to be calculated during action execution.*

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### State
Context state is available when a consequent is executed. The same context state is passed across rule execution. Context state is stored until it is deleted. Context state changes can be evaluated by rules. By convention `s` represents the state to be evaluated by a rule.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :flow do
  # state condition uses 's'
  when_all s.status == "start" do
    # state update on 's'
    s.status = "next"
    puts "start"
  end

  when_all s.status == "next" do
    s.status = "last"
    puts "next"
  end

  when_all s.status == "last" do
    s.status = "end"
    puts "last"
    # deletes state at the end
    delete_state
  end
end

# modifies context state
Durable.update_state :flow, { :status => "start"}
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Identity
Facts with the same property names and values are considered equal when asserted or retracted. Events with the same property names and values are considered different when posted because the posting time matters. 

```ruby
Durable.ruleset :bookstore do
  # this rule will trigger for events with status
  when_all +m.status do
    puts "bookstore-> Reference #{m.reference} status #{m.status}"
  end

  when_all +m.name do
    puts "bookstore-> Added: #{m.name}"
  end

  when_all none(+m.name) do
    puts "bookstore-> No books"
  end  
end

# will return 0 because the fact assert was successful 
puts Durable.assert :bookstore, {
            :name => 'The new book',
            :seller => 'bookstore',
            :reference => '75323',
            :price => 500}

# will return 212 because the fact has already been asserted 
begin
  Durable.assert :bookstore, {
              :reference => '75323',
              :name => 'The new book',
              :price => 500,
              :seller => 'bookstore'}
rescue Exception => e
  puts "bookstore expected: #{e}"
end

# will return 0 because a new event is being posted
Durable.post :bookstore, {
             :reference => '75323',
             :status => 'Active'}

# will return 0 because a new event is being posted
Durable.post :bookstore, {
             :reference => '75323',
             :status => 'Active'}

Durable.retract :bookstore, {
            :name => 'The new book',
            :reference => '75323',
            :price => 500,
            :seller => 'bookstore'}
```

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Error Codes

hen asserting a fact, retracting a fact, posting an event or updating state context, the following exceptions can be thrown:

* MessageObservedError: The fact has already been asserted or the event has already been posted.
* MessageNotHandledError: The event or fact was not captured because it did not match any rule.

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents) 

## Antecendents
### Simple Filter
A rule antecedent is an expression. The left side of the expression represents an event or fact property. The right side defines a pattern to be matched. By convention events or facts are represented with the `m` name. Context state are represented with the `s` name.  

Logical operators:  
* Unary: - (does not exist), + (exists)  
* Logical operators: &, |  
* Relational operators: < , >, <=, >=, ==, !=  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :expense do
  when_all (m.subject == "approve") | (m.subject == "ok") do
    puts "Approved subject: #{m.subject}"
  end
end

Durable.post :expense, { :subject => "approve" }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Pattern Matching
durable_rules implements a simple pattern matching dialect. Similar to lua, it uses % to escape, which vastly simplifies writing expressions. Expressions are compiled down into a deterministic state machine, thus backtracking is not supported. Event processing is O(n) guaranteed (n being the size of the event).  

**Repetition**  
\+ 1 or more repetitions  
\* 0 or more repetitions  
? optional (0 or 1 occurrence)  

**Special**  
() group  
| disjunct  
[] range  
{} repeat  

**Character classes**  
.	all characters  
%a	letters  
%c	control characters  
%d	digits  
%l	lower case letters  
%p	punctuation characters  
%s	space characters  
%u	upper case letters  
%w	alphanumeric characters  
%x	hexadecimal digits  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :match do
  when_all (m.url.matches("(https?://)?([0-9a-z.-]+)%.[a-z]{2,6}(/[A-z0-9_.-]+/?)*")) do
    puts "match -> #{m.url}"
  end
end

Durable.post :match, { :url => "https://github.com" }

Durable.post :match, { :url => "http://github.com/jruizgit/rul!es" }, -> e, state {
  puts "match expected:#{e}"
}

Durable.post :match, { :url => "https://github.com/jruizgit/rules/blob/master/docs/rb/reference.md" }

Durable.post :match, { :url => "//rules" }, -> e, state {
  puts "match expected:#{e}"
}

Durable.post :match, { :url => "https://github.c/jruizgit/rules" }, -> e, state {
  puts "match expected:#{e}"
}
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### String Operations  
The pattern matching dialect can be used for common string operations. The `imatches` function enables case insensitive pattern matching.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :strings do
  when_all m.subject.matches("hello.*") do
    puts "string starts with hello: #{m.subject}"
  end

  when_all m.subject.matches(".*hello") do
    puts "string ends with hello: #{m.subject}"
  end

  when_all m.subject.imatches(".*Hello.*") do
    puts "string contains hello (case insensitive): #{m.subject}"
  end
end

Durable.assert :strings, { :subject => "HELLO world" }
Durable.assert :strings, { :subject => "world hello" }
Durable.assert :strings, { :subject => "hello hi" }
Durable.assert :strings, { :subject => "has Hello string" }
Durable.assert :strings, { :subject => "does not match" }
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents) 

### Correlated Sequence
Rules can be used to efficiently evaluate sequences of correlated events or facts. The fraud detection rule in the example below shows a pattern of three events: the second event amount being more than 200% the first event amount and the third event amount greater than the average of the other two.  

By default a correlated sequences capture distinct messages. In the example below the second event satisfies the second and the third condition, however the event will be captured only for the second condition. Use the `distinct` attribute to disable distinct event or fact correlation.

The `when_all` annotation expresses a sequence of events or facts. The `=` operator is used to name events or facts, which can be referenced in subsequent expressions. When referencing events or facts, all properties are available. Complex patterns can be expressed using arithmetic operators.  

Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :risk do
  when_all # distinct(true),
           c.first = m.amount > 10,
           c.second = m.amount > first.amount * 2,
           c.third = m.amount > (first.amount + second.amount) / 2 do
    puts "fraud detected -> #{first.amount}" 
    puts "               -> #{second.amount}"
    puts "               -> #{third.amount}"
  end
end

Durable.post :risk, { :t => "purchase", :amount => 50 }
Durable.post :risk, { :t => "purchase", :amount => 200 }
Durable.post :risk, { :t => "purchase", :amount => 251 } 
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Choice of Sequences
durable_rules allows expressing and efficiently evaluating richer events sequences. In the example below any of the two event\fact sequences will trigger an action.

The following two functions can be used and combined to define richer event sequences:  
* all: a set of event or fact patterns. All of them are required to match to trigger an action.  
* any: a set of event or fact patterns. Any one match will trigger an action.  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :expense do
  when_any all(c.first = m.subject == "approve", 
               c.second = m.amount == 1000),
           all(c.third = m.subject == "jumbo", 
               c.fourth = m.amount == 10000) do
    if first
      puts "Approved #{first.subject} #{second.amount}"
    else
      puts "Approved #{third.subject} #{fourth.amount}"
    end
  end
end

Durable.post :expense, { :subject => "approve" }
Durable.post :expense, { :amount => 1000 }
Durable.post :expense, { :subject => "jumbo" }
Durable.post :expense, { :amount => 10000 }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Lack of Information
In some cases lack of information is meaningful. The `none` function can be used in rules with correlated sequences to evaluate the lack of information.  

*Note: the `none` function requires information to reason about lack of information. That is, it will not trigger any actions if no events or facts have been registered in the corresponding rule.*

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :risk do
  when_all c.first = m.t == "deposit",
           none(m.t == "balance"),
           c.third = m.t == "withdrawal",
           c.fourth = m.t == "chargeback" do
    puts "fraud detected #{first.t} #{third.t} #{fourth.t}"
  end
end

Durable.assert :risk, { :t => "deposit" }
Durable.assert :risk, { :t => "withdrawal" }
Durable.assert :risk, { :t => "chargeback" }

Durable.assert :risk, { :sid => 1, :t => "balance" }
Durable.assert :risk, { :sid => 1, :t => "deposit" }
Durable.assert :risk, { :sid => 1, :t => "withdrawal" }
Durable.assert :risk, { :sid => 1, :t => "chargeback" }
Durable.retract :risk, { :sid => 1, :t => "balance" }
```  

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Nested Objects
Queries on nested events or facts are also supported. The `.` notation is used for defining conditions on properties in nested objects.  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :expense do
  when_all c.bill = (m.t == "bill") & (m.invoice.amount > 50),
           c.account = (m.t == "account") & (m.payment.invoice.amount == bill.invoice.amount) do
    puts "bill amount -> #{bill.invoice.amount}" 
    puts "account payment amount -> #{account.payment.invoice.amount}" 
  end
end

Durable.post :expense, { t:"bill", :invoice => { :amount => 1000 }}
Durable.post :expense, { t:"account", :payment => { :invoice => { :amount => 1000 }}}
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  

### Arrays

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :risk do 
  # matching primitive array
  when_all m.payments.allItems(item > 1000) do
    puts "fraud 1 detected #{m.payments}"
  end

  # matching object array
  when_all m.payments.allItems((item.amount < 250) | (item.amount >= 300)) do
    puts "fraud 2 detected #{m.payments}"
  end

  # matching object array
  when_all m.cards.anyItem(item.matches("three.*")) do
    puts "fraud 3 detected #{m.cards}"
  end

  # matching nested arrays
  when_all m.payments.anyItem(item.allItems(item < 100)) do
    puts "fraud 4 detected #{m.payments}"
  end

  # matching array and value
  when_all (m.payments.allItems(item > 100) & (m.cash == true)) do
    puts "fraud 5 detected #{m.payments}"
  end

  when_all (m.field == 1) & m.payments.allItems(item.allItems((item > 100) & (item < 1000))) do
    puts "fraud 6 detected #{m.payments}"
  end

  when_all (m.field == 1) & m.payments.allItems(item.anyItem((item > 100) | (item < 50))) do
    puts "fraud 7 detected #{m.payments}"
  end
end

Durable.post :risk, { :payments => [ 2500, 150, 450 ] }
Durable.post :risk, { :payments => [ 1500, 3500, 4500 ] }
Durable.post :risk, { :payments => [ { :amount => 200 }, { :amount => 300 }, { :amount => 400 } ] }
Durable.post :risk, { :cards => [ "one card", "two cards", "three cards" ] }
Durable.post :risk, { :payments => [ [ 10, 20, 30 ], [ 30, 40, 50 ], [ 10, 20 ] ] }
Durable.post :risk, { :payments => [ 150, 350, 450 ], :cash => true }
Durable.post :risk, { :field => 1, :payments => [ [ 200, 300 ], [ 150, 200 ] ] }
Durable.post :risk, { :field => 1, :payments => [ [ 20, 180 ], [ 90, 190 ] ] }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  


### Facts and Events as rvalues

Aside from scalars (strings, number and boolean values), it is possible to use the fact or event observed on the right side of an expression.   

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :risk do
  # compares properties in the same event, this expression is evaluated in the client 
  when_all m.debit > m.credit * 2 do
    puts "debit #{m.debit} more than twice the credit #{m.credit}"
  end
  # compares two correlated events, this expression is evaluated in the backend
  when_all c.first = m.amount > 100,
           c.second = m.amount > first.amount + m.amount / 2  do
    puts "fraud detected -> #{first.amount}"
    puts "fraud detected -> #{second.amount}"
  end
end

Durable.post :risk, { :debit => 220, :credit => 100 }
Durable.post :risk, { :debit => 150, :credit => 100 }
Durable.post :risk, { :amount => 200 }
Durable.post :risk, { :amount => 500 }
```

[top](reference.md#table-of-contents) 

## Consequents
### Conflict Resolution
Event and fact evaluation can lead to multiple consequents. The triggering order can be controlled by using the `pri` (salience) function. Actions with lower value are executed first. The default value for all actions is 0.

In this example, notice how the last rule is triggered first, as it has the highest priority.
```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :attributes do
  when_all pri(3), m.amount < 300 do
    puts "attributes P3 -> #{m.amount}"
  end

  when_all pri(2), m.amount < 200 do
    puts "attributes P2 -> #{m.amount}"
  end

  when_all pri(1), m.amount < 100  do
    puts "attributes P1 -> #{m.amount}"
  end
end

Durable.assert :attributes, { :amount => 50 }
Durable.assert :attributes, { :amount => 150 }
Durable.assert :attributes, { :amount => 250 }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Action Batches
When a high number of events or facts satisfy a consequent, the consequent results can be delivered in batches.

* count: defines the exact number of times the rule needs to be satisfied before scheduling the action.   
* cap: defines the maximum number of times the rule needs to be satisfied before scheduling the action.  

This example batches exactly three approvals and caps the number of rejects to two:
```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :expense do
  # this rule will trigger as soon as three events match the condition
  when_all count(3), m.amount < 100 do
    for f in m do
      puts "approved ->#{f}"
    end
  end

  # this rule will be triggered when 'expense' is asserted batching at most two results
  when_all cap(2), 
           c.expense = m.amount >= 100,
           c.approval = m.review == true do
    for f in m do
      puts "rejected ->#{f}"
    end
  end
end

Durable.post_batch :expense, [{ :amount => 10 },
                              { :amount => 20 },
                              { :amount => 100 },
                              { :amount => 30 },
                              { :amount => 200 },
                              { :amount => 400 }]
Durable.assert :expense, { :review => true }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Async Actions  
The consequent action can be asynchronous. When the action is finished, the `complete` function has to be called. By default an action is considered abandoned after 5 seconds. This value can be changed by returning a different number in the action function or extended by calling `renew_action_lease`.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :flow do
  # async actions take a callback argument to signal completion
  when_all s.state == "first" do |c, complete|
    Thread.new do
      sleep 3
      s.state = "second"
      puts "first completed"
      complete.call nil
    end
  end

  when_all s.state == "second" do |c, complete|
    Thread.new do
      sleep 6
      s.state = "third"
      puts "second completed"

      # completes the action after 6 seconds
      # use the first argument to signal an error
      complete.call Exception('error detected')
    end
    # overrides the 5 second default abandon timeout
    10
  end
end

Durable.update_state :flow, { :state => "first" }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)  
### Unhandled Exceptions  
When exceptions are not handled by actions, they are stored in the context state. This enables writing exception handling rules.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :flow do
  when_all m.action == "start" do
    raise "Unhandled Exception!"
  end
  
  # when the exception property exists
  when_all +s.exception do
    puts "#{s.exception}"
    s.exception = nil
  end
end

Durable.post :flow, { :action => "start" }
```  
[top](reference.md#table-of-contents)   
## Flow Structures
### Statechart
Rules can be organized using statecharts. A statechart is a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The state context is in one of a number of possible states with conditional transitions between these states. 

Statechart rules:  
* A statechart can have one or more states.  
* A statechart requires an initial state.  
* An initial state is defined as a vertex without incoming edges.  
* A state can have zero or more triggers.  
* A state can have zero or more states (see [nested states](reference.md#nested-states)).  
* A trigger has a destination state.  
* A trigger can have a rule (absence means state enter).  
* A trigger can have an action.  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.statechart :expense do
  # initial state :input with two triggers
  state :input do
    # trigger to move to :denied given a condition
    to :denied, when_all((m.subject == "approve") & (m.amount > 1000)) do
      # action executed before state change
      puts "denied amount #{m.amount}"
    end

    to :pending, when_all((m.subject == "approve") & (m.amount <= 1000)) do
      puts "requesting approve amount #{m.amount}"
    end
  end  

  # intermediate state :pending with two triggers
  state :pending do
    to :approved, when_all(m.subject == "approved") do
      puts "expense approved"

### Nested States
Nested states allow for writing compact statecharts. If a context is in the nested state, it also (implicitly) is in the surrounding state. The statechart will attempt to handle any event in the context of the sub-state. If the sub-state does not  handle an event, the event is automatically handled at the context of the super-state.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.statechart :worker do
  # super-state :work has two states and one trigger
  state :work do
    # sub-state :enter has only one trigger
    state :enter do
      to :process, when_all(m.subject == "enter") do
        puts "start process"
      end
    end

    state :process do
      to :process, when_all(m.subject == "continue") do
        puts "continue processing"
      end
    end

    # the super-state trigger will be evaluated for all sub-state triggers
    to :canceled, when_all(pri(1), m.subject == "cancel") do
      puts "cancel process"
    end
  end

  state :canceled
end
# will move the statechart to the 'work.process' sub-state
Durable.post :worker, { :subject => "enter" }

# will keep the statechart to the 'work.process' sub-state
Durable.post :worker, { :subject => "continue" }
Durable.post :worker, { :subject => "continue" }

# will move the statechart out of the work state
Durable.post :worker, { :subject => "cancel" }
```

### Flowchart
A flowchart is another way of organizing a ruleset flow. In a flowchart each stage represents an action to be executed. So (unlike the statechart state), when applied to the context state, it results in a transition to another stage.  

Flowchart rules:  
* A flowchart can have one or more stages.  
* A flowchart requires an initial stage.  
* An initial stage is defined as a vertex without incoming edges.  
* A stage can have an action.  
* A stage can have zero or more conditions.  
* A condition has a rule and a destination stage.  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.flowchart :expense do
  # initial stage :input has two conditions
  stage :input
  to :request, when_all((m.subject == "approve") & (m.amount <= 1000))
  to :deny, when_all((m.subject == "approve") & (m.amount > 1000))
  
  # intermediate stage :request has an action and three conditions
  stage :request do
    puts "requesting approve"
  end
  to :approve, when_all(m.subject == "approved")
  to :deny, when_all(m.subject == "denied")
  # reflexive condition: if met, returns to the same stage
  to :request, when_any(m.subject == "retry")
  
  stage :approve do
    puts "expense approved"
  end

  stage :deny do
    puts "expense denied"
  end
end

# events for the default flowchart instance, approved after retry
Durable.post :expense, { :subject => "approve", :amount => 100 }
Durable.post :expense, { :subject => "retry" }
Durable.post :expense, { :subject => "approved" }

# events for the flowchart instance '1', denied after first try
Durable.post :expense, {:sid => 1, :subject => "approve", :amount => 100}
Durable.post :expense, {:sid => 1, :subject => "denied"}

# event for the flowchart instance '2' immediately denied    
Durable.post :expense, {:sid => 2, :subject => "approve", :amount => 10000}
```

### Timers
Events can be scheduled with timers. A timeout condition can be included in the rule antecedent. By default a timeout is triggered as an event (observed only once). Timeouts can also be triggered as facts by 'manual reset' timers, the timers can be reset during action execution (see last example).

* start_timer: starts a timer with the name and duration specified (manual_reset is optional).
* reset_timer: resets a 'manual reset' timer.
* cancel_timer: cancels ongoing timer.
* timeout: used as an antecedent condition.

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :timer do
  when_all m.subject == "start" do
    start_timer "MyTimer", 5
  end

  when_all timeout("MyTimer") do
    puts "timer-> timeout"
  end
end

Durable.post :timer, { :subject => "start" }
```  

The example below uses a timer to detect higher event rate:  

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.statechart :risk do
  state :start do
    to :meter do
      start_timer "RiskTimer", 5
    end
  end  

  state :meter do
    to :fraud, when_all(count(3), c.message = m.amount > 100) do
      for e in m do
        puts e.message
      end
    end

    to :exit, when_all(timeout("RiskTimer")) do
      puts "exit"
    end
  end

  state :fraud
  state :exit
end

# three events in a row will trigger the fraud rule
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 200 } 
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 300 } 
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 400 }

# two events will exit after 5 seconds
Durable.post 'risk', { :sid => 1, :amount => 500 } 
Durable.post 'risk', { :sid => 1, :amount => 600 } 
```  

In this example a manual reset timer is used for measuring velocity. 

```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.statechart :risk do
  state :start do
    to :meter do
      # will start a manual reset timer
      start_timer "VelocityTimer", 5, true
    end
  end  

  state :meter do
    to :meter, when_all(cap(100), 
                        c.message = m.amount > 100,
                        timeout("VelocityTimer")) do
      puts "velocity: #{m.width} events in 5 seconds"
      # resets and restarts the manual reset timer
      reset_timer "VelocityTimer"
      start_timer "VelocityTimer", 5, true
    end

    to :meter, when_all(timeout("VelocityTimer")) do
      puts "velocity: no events in 5 seconds"
      reset_timer "VelocityTimer"
      start_timer "VelocityTimer", 5, true
    end
  end
end

# the velocity will 4 events in 5 seconds
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 200 } 
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 300 } 
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 50 }
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 300 } 
Durable.post 'risk', { :amount => 400 }
```
